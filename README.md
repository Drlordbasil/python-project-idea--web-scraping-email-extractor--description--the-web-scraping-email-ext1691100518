## Code Explanation

The `EmailExtractor` class is responsible for extracting email addresses from websites. It uses web scraping techniques to crawl through web pages, search for email addresses, and apply filters and validations.

The main steps involved in the extraction process are:

1. Crawling the website: The program takes a starting URL as input and uses web scraping techniques to crawl through the web pages of the target website, searching for email addresses embedded within the HTML.

2. Email extraction: Using the BeautifulSoup library, the program identifies email addresses by searching for common email patterns (e.g., "example@example.com") or by detecting email-related HTML tags (e.g., `<a href="mailto:example@example.com">`).

3. Filters and validation: The program can apply filters to only extract email addresses that match specific criteria, such as domain names or keywords. It can also perform basic email address validation to ensure extracted addresses are valid and accurately captured.

4. Database management: The program provides options to store the extracted email addresses in a centralized database, such as SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB, enabling easy access and organization of the data for further analysis.

5. Reporting and exporting: The program can generate reports summarizing the extracted email addresses, including information such as the source URL, date of extraction, and any applied filters. It also supports exporting the data to various formats, such as CSV or Excel, for further manipulation or integration with other tools.
