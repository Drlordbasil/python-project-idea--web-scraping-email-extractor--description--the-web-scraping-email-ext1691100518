import concurrent.futures
Here are some optimizations for the Python script:

1. Use a `Session` object in the `requests` module to reuse the underlying TCP connection for multiple requests, improving performance.

```python
# Before class definition
session = requests.Session()

# Inside crawl_website method (replace requests.get(url) with session.get(url))
response = session.get(url)
```

2. Perform email address extraction and filtering concurrently using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to improve efficiency.

```python

# Inside extract_emails method (replace self.crawl_website(self.starting_url))
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.submit(self.crawl_website, self.starting_url)
```

3. Avoid unnecessary function calls by using `set.update` method and list comprehensions.

```python
# Inside extract_email_addresses_from_page method (replace email_addresses.update(email_matches))
email_addresses.update(email_matches)

# Inside filter_emails method (replace filtered_email_addresses = set())
filtered_email_addresses = {email_address for email_address in self.email_addresses
                            if any(keyword in email_address for keyword in self.filter_criteria.get('keywords', []))
                            or any(domain_name in email_address.split('@')[1] for domain_name in self.filter_criteria.get('domain_names', []))}
self.email_addresses = filtered_email_addresses
```

4. Use `filter` and `map` functions instead of `for ` loops to simplify code and improve readability.

```python
# Inside validate_emails method
validated_email_addresses = set(
    filter(self.validate_email_address, self.email_addresses))
self.email_addresses = validated_email_addresses

# Inside generate_report method
email_list = '\n'.join(
    f"- {email_address}" for email_address in self.email_addresses)
report = f"Source URL: {self.starting_url}\n" \
         f"Date of extraction: {date.today()}\n" \
         f"Applied filters: {json.dumps(self.filter_criteria)}\n" \
         f"Email addresses:\n{email_list}\n"
print(report)
```

These optimizations should help improve the performance and efficiency of the script.
